# Friis geometry-based beamforming

In this experiment, the bamforming weights (phases) are computed based on the assumption of free-space and known distances between all antennas and the target device.

The weights are computed in [compute_beam_forming_weights.py](https://github.com/techtile-by-dramco/experiments/blob/73b6b710fe99a4d2259ac602a803231bf69dd7e1/03_geometry_based_beamforming/031_Friis/processing/compute_beam_forming_weights.py) and stored in [config-phase-friis.yml](https://github.com/techtile-by-dramco/experiments/blob/73b6b710fe99a4d2259ac602a803231bf69dd7e1/03_geometry_based_beamforming/031_Friis/client/config-phase-friis.yml).
