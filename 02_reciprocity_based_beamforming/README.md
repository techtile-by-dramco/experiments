# Reciprocity-based beamforming

Reciprocity-based beamforming is a technique used in wireless communication systems, particularly in the context of time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, to simplify the calibration and implementation of beamforming. It relies on the principle of reciprocity, which states that the channel response between two antennas at the transmitter and receiver is the same (or very similar) when the roles of the transmitter and receiver are reversed. In other words, if you transmit a signal from antenna A to antenna B and measure the channel response, it should be nearly identical when you transmit from B to A.
