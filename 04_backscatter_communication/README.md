# Backscatter communication

Backscatter communication is a wireless communication technique that enables devices to communicate by reflecting or modulating existing radio frequency (RF) signals instead of generating their own signals. This approach is energy-efficient and can be suitable for low-power and low-cost devices, making it advantageous for certain applications like the Internet of Things (IoT). It enables the development of energy-neutral devices due to significantly lower energy requirements compared to powered active transmitters.

## Why backscatter communication in Techtile?

1) The reciprocity based approach seems to be the most suitable and feasible solution to enable coherent beamforming.
