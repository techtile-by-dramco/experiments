This measurement is used to study the phase difference between the two RX chains (fed through RX1 and RX2) when varying the rx gain.
As can be observed (note depending on the carrier frequency) a phase jump occurs between RX_gain 33 and 34.

Several measurements were conducted with different cable lengths to induce different phase delays.
